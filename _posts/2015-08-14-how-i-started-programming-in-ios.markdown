It is always good to start learning something new. I would love to learn everything that I want without the need to choose it bas d on my priorities. As I am just a normal human I have to make my decisions.

In school I used to be a regular student and I say I was lucky because I did not like to study (now I know I did not know how to do it) but I had good grades only with information I remembered from classes. I only learned how to study after ending high school. Since I learned how to do it I just made few changes in the process and now I think I mastered it, at least in a way that works for me.

When I decided that my priority was to learn how to code iOS apps I had been programming in Java for more than 1 year and my programming logic and object oriented programming skills were very sharp. As Swift had been just released and people were still using much more Objective-C, I wanted to begin with this old and robust language. I first started reading the [Objective-C Programming:The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/objective-c-programming/) book but it needs to be read in front of a computer to do all the exercises and as I was reading it in a bus on my way to the office it was not a good idea and I also found it boring because they try to teach the C language before Objective-C and I think it was not necessary.

If I had to be on my computer to learn I had to do something more dynamic. I looked for videos on Youtube and I could not find any good material. In a Google search I knew about the awesome [lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com). Until now these were the best video classes I have ever watched. Thanks to [Simon Allardice](http://simonallardice.com) who knows how to teach much better than many professors in universities. I watched the [Objective-C Essential Training](http://www.lynda.com/Objective-C-tutorials/Objective-C-Essential-Training/143328-2.html), [iOS App Development](http://www.lynda.com/iOS-tutorials/iOS-App-Development-Essential-Training/159179-2.html?srchtrk=index:1%0Alinktypeid:2%0Aq:ios%0Apage:1%0As:relevance%0Asa:true%0Aproducttypeid:2) and also [Coredata](http://www.lynda.com/iOS-tutorials/Core-Data-iOS-OS-X/101461-2.html) courses. These courses gave me the knowledge to build my first app (with some help of [Satck Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), of course).

After building my first app I got less anxious so I could stop to learn everything the Objective-C language had to offer and I did not want to read the Big Nerd Ranch Guide book, which I did not like. Thanks to Google I found the [Programming in Objective-C](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Objective-C-6th-Developers-Library/dp/0321967607/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1439565756&sr=8-3&keywords=objective+c) by [Stephen G. Kochan](https://twitter.com/sgkochan). This book has a good rating on Amazon and this review ([http://amzn.to/1LbRjMQ](http://amzn.to/1LbRjMQ)) was crucial to make me want to buy it.

This book taught me everything I can do with Objective-C (I guess). Java does not have things like categories or delegates and I think it is very useful.

The next step after learning Objective-C was to learn Swift. I bought the [Meng To's book](https://designcode.io) and I learned something about design with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and then I gave my first steps in the Swift world. It was very easy and much more simpler than Objective-C. Coding in Swift is like coding in Objective-C in a easier way. I made another app (not on Appstore), now in Swift. And having more experience I could build it in 3 days.

I have been learning Swift since this year's WWDC when they announced the Swift 2 and the decision to make it open source. At that time Apple also released their new Swift books [Swift Programming Language](https://itunes.apple.com/br/book/swift-programming-language/id1002622538?mt=11) and [Using Swift With Cocoa and Objective-C](https://itunes.apple.com/br/book/using-swift-cocoa-objective/id1002624212?mt=11) which are the books that I used to learn more about all the tools that we can use.

And this is the process that I use to learn new languages. I watch some videos, I do some programming and then I read a book about the language. Of course it is not enough to master the knowledge of a programming language. For me it includes facing real life problems and reading more. I still have some other books that I want to read until the end of this year.

Posting things here is also a good way to strengthen my skills.
